## Presentation

My final project of 1st year in Bachelor in Computer Science was to create a CV site with several constraints :
- The site is written in HTML/CSS and Javascript;
- The site must include elements learned during the year to see if the different concepts were understood;
- The Project was to be carried out in 3 months and without using templates or frameworks;
- The site had to be a bit RESPONSIVE

This project is being improved, which explains the presence of some display problems.
